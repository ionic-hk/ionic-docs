This command creates a deploy build on Ionic Appflow. While the build is running, it prints the remote build log to the terminal.

Customizing the build:
- The `--environment` and `--channel` options can be used to customize the groups of values exposed to the build.

Apart from `--commit`, every option can be specified using the full name setup within the Appflow [Dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com).
