# ion-segment-button

Segment buttons are groups of related buttons inside of a [Segment](../segment). They are displayed in a horizontal row. A segment button can be checked by default by adding the `checked` attribute or by setting the `value` of the segment to the `value` of the segment button. Only one segment button should be selected at a time.
