# ion-card

Cards are a standard piece of UI that serves as an entry point to more detailed
information. A card can be a single component, but is often made up of some
header, title, subtitle, and content. `ion-card` is broken up into several
sub-components to reflect this. Please see `ion-card-content`,
`ion-card-header`, `ion-card-title`, `ion-card-subtitle`.
