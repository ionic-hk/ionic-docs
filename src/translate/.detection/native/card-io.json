For more info, please see the [Card IO plugin docs](https://github.com/card-io/card.io-Cordova-Plugin).\n\nNote: For use with iOS 10 + When building your app with the iOS 10 SDK +, you have to add some info to the info.plist file. This is due to increased security in iOS 10. Go to your app directory and search for the <your app name>Info.plist file. Add the following lines in the main <dict> element.\n```xml\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>To scan credit cards.</string>\n```\n```typescript\nimport { CardIO } from '@ionic-native/card-io/ngx';\n\nconstructor(private cardIO: CardIO) { }\n\n...\n\n\nthis.cardIO.canScan()\n  .then(\n    (res: boolean) => {\n      if(res){\n        let options = {\n          requireExpiry: true,\n          requireCVV: false,\n          requirePostalCode: false\n        };\n        this.cardIO.scan(options);\n      }\n    }\n  );\n```",
