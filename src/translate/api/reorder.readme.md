# ion-reorder

Reorder is a component that allows an item in a group of items to be dragged to change its order within that group. It must be used within an `ion-reorder-group` to provide a visual drag and drop interface.

`ion-reorder` is the anchor used to drag and drop the items inside of the `ion-reorder-group`. See the [Reorder Group](../reorder-group) for more information on how to complete the reorder operation.
