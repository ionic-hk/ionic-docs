# ion-searchbar

Searchbars represent a text field that can be used to search through a collection. They can be displayed inside of a toolbar or the main content.

A Searchbar should be used instead of an input to search lists. A clear button is displayed upon entering input in the searchbar's text field. Clicking on the clear button will erase the text field and the input will remain focused. A cancel button can be enabled which will clear the input and lose the focus upon click.
