# ion-menu-toggle

The MenuToggle component can be used to toggle a menu open or closed.

By default, it's only visible when the selected menu is active. A menu is active when it can be opened/closed. If the menu is disabled or it's being presented as a split-pane, the menu is marked as non-active and ion-menu-toggle hides itself.

In case it's desired to keep `ion-menu-toggle` always visible, the `autoHide` property can be set to `false`.
