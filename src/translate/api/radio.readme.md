# ion-radio

Radios are generally used as a set of related options inside of a group, but they can also be used alone. Pressing on a radio will check it. They can also be checked programmatically by setting the `checked` property.

An `ion-radio-group` can be used to group a set of radios. When radios are inside of a [radio group](../radio-group), only one radio in the group will be checked at any time. Pressing a radio will check it and uncheck the previously selected radio, if there is one. If a radio is not in a group with another radio, then both radios will have the ability to be checked at the same time.
